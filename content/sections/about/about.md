Hey there! I'm Alex, an enthusiastic Software Developer on a mission to master the art of Software Engineering at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. Proud graduate of Integrify Academy's Full Stack Developer program (October 2022), I've delved into the realms of Full Stack Development and Cloud Services.

Currently wearing my volunteer hat as a Full Stack Developer at Junction, a hackathon powerhouse. I'm all about boosting the JunctionApp, making hackathon experiences even more awesome. This role has honed my skills and teamwork in the real-world software development arena.

In my quest for growth as a Software Developer, I'm actively pursuing exciting opportunities to level up. I'm particularly drawn to roles that blend frontend and backend magic, and I'm eager to dive into the intricacies of software development processes and project management. Let's connect and make some coding magic happen!
