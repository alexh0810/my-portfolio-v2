I’m Alex Ho, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a strong emphasis on front-end technologies. I honed my skills through intensive Full Stack Development and DevOps training at Integrify Academy, earning the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification to strengthen my technical expertise. My academic foundation in Software Development from Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, combined with hands-on collaboration with Finnish enterprises, has equipped me to deliver innovative solutions and drive excellence in web development.

My career journey began as a Volunteer Full Stack Developer at Junction, where I played a key role in modernizing the hackathon platform. By utilizing JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Docker, and Git, I implemented impactful enhancements that elevated the platform’s functionality and user experience.

I further advanced as a Full Stack Developer Intern at Munchi, where I refined my expertise in JavaScript, React, Docker, and Google Cloud. My work focused on optimizing storefront interfaces and streamlining deployment processes across multiple restaurant platforms.

I’m actively seeking opportunities as a Software Developer, Front-End Developer, or Back-End Developer, and I’m open to roles of any type. Let’s connect to discuss how I can contribute to achieving your technology goals!
