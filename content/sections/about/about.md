Greetings, I'm Alex Ho, a dedicated Full Stack Developer with a robust focus on front-end technologies. I completed intensive Full Stack Development and DevOps training at Integrify Academy, achieving AWS Cloud Practitioner certification to augment my technical skills. With a solid foundation in Software Development from Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences and hands-on experience in collaborative projects with Finnish enterprises, I specialize in delivering innovative solutions and driving excellence in web development.

My career journey began as a Volunteer Full Stack Developer at Junction, where I played a pivotal role in revitalizing the hackathon platform. Leveraging expertise in JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Docker, and Git, I successfully implemented enhancements to elevate user experience and functionality.

Subsequently, I advanced to a Full Stack Developer Internship at Munchi, refining proficiencies in JavaScript, React, Docker, and Google Cloud. My contributions centered on optimizing the storefront and streamlining deployment processes across multiple restaurant interfaces.

Currently excelling as a Restaurant Manager at Momotoko Restaurants, I oversee operations with a strong emphasis on team leadership and ensuring unparalleled customer satisfaction.

Let's connect and explore how we can achieve your technology goals together.
