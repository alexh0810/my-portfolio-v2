I'm Alex Ho, a Junior Software Developer passionate about crafting efficient, user-centric solutions. With comprehensive Full Stack Development and DevOps training from Integrify Academy, I bring a robust technical foundation to every project. My Software Development education from Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, enriched by practical collaborations with Finnish companies, has shaped my approach to building scalable, innovative solutions.

At Junction, as a Volunteer Full Stack Developer, I spearheaded the modernization of their hackathon platform. Leveraging a modern tech stack including React, MongoDB, and Docker, I implemented key features that significantly enhanced user engagement and platform reliability. This experience taught me the value of clean code architecture and efficient deployment strategies.

During my internship at Munchi as a Full Stack Developer, I specialized in optimizing digital storefronts across multiple restaurant platforms. Working with React, JavaScript, and Google Cloud, I improved deployment workflows and developed responsive interfaces that boosted user satisfaction and operational efficiency.

My technical toolkit includes:

- Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- Backend: Node.js, MongoDB
- DevOps: Docker, Git, Google Cloud
- Methodologies: Agile, CI/CD

I'm currently seeking challenging roles as a Software Developer, Front-End Developer, or Back-End Developer where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue growing professionally. Let's connect and explore how my skills and enthusiasm can help drive your team's success!
